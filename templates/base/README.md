Welcome, valiant sorcerer of the code realm! This enchanted backend service, powered by **Node.js**, guarded by **Express**, and enchanted with **Sequelize**, will guide your data safely to the mystical vaults of **MariaDB**. All this was conjured through the powers of the legendary **Wizard Build** CLI! 🧙‍♂️

- **🔮 Modular Code**: Keep your mystical incantations (code) clean and organized.
- **🧪 Pre-Configured Spells**: Ready-to-use scripts for development, testing, and production.
- **🧑‍🔧 Environment Secrets**: Protect your magical variables in `.env` scrolls.
- **🧹 Clean Code**: Code linting and formatting tools keep curses (errors) at bay!
- **🐉 Docker-Ready**: Deploy your spells inside a mystical Docker cauldron.
- **🧙 Wizard-Approved Tech Stack**: Choose your framework, ORM, and database like a true spellcaster.
