Welcome, valiant sorcerer of the code realm!

- **🧪 Pre-Configured Spells**: Ready-to-use scripts for development, testing, and production.
- **🧑‍🔧 Environment Secrets**: Protect your magical variables in `.env` scrolls.
- **🧹 Clean Code**: Code linting and formatting tools keep curses (errors) at bay!
- **🐉 Docker-Ready**: Deploy your spells inside a mystical Docker cauldron.
- **🧙 Wizard-Approved Tech Stack**: Choose your framework, ORM, and database like a true spellcaster.
